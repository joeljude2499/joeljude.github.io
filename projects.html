										<h1>Projects</h1>

									<p>The website was built during my time as an intern at DLS Consultancy and the contents were provided by my employer. There was a lot of adjustments that were given by my director as the contents and design was approved by her. My main goal for this project was to ensure she was satisfied with the entire website.</p>
									<p>I manage to find a little inspiration from other recruitment companies to ensure the content and approach of the website was best suited for the recruitment industry. Most of the employees at the time would give their feedback on the design and animations. I would do my best to research and find ways to ensure their ideas would be displayed on the website.</p>
									<p>The website was first drawn up in wix for the content. Once I had begun my internship my job was to take the content and put it into the designated pages and titles. I begun completing the website through Adobe Dreamweaver with codes like Javascript, HTML and CSS. However at the final stages of the project, my director had informed me that she would like the website to be done through Wordpress.</p>
									<p>At this point I would have to start over placing the elements and effects with no prior knowledge of using Wordpress. I then decided to use Youtube and GitHub tutorial to find ways in designing the website and ensuring it is responsive on different ratios or scales. I used elementor and managed to fit a few plugins to insert a resume application form called jobseeker. From this point, I was learning PHP and started experimenting if the job form can be directed to our company email. I was successful in linking the form submission to our email and also made a page where we could post jobs and job descriptions just like Jobstreet and Hiredly.</p>
